# BlackJack-Game

### A Little Nostalgia

##### This is the very FIRST script I ever wrote.  I learned Perl using only "Perl in a Nutshell" in 2001.


* This is a command line game.
* The purpose for learning Perl at the time was to utilize scripting for patching and installs in Unicenter Network and System Management Enterprise application.
* No the "House" does not always win :-)
